# Stats about Germany: a data visualization project
## Overview

The program was developed for the course Data Visualization (103001004) at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

In this project, we have implemented a dynamic and interactive data visualization tool to gain insights into the population of Germany, and to answer the following specific questions:

1. **Percentage of foreigners per state**: 
How did the percentage of foreigners in the population of Germany vary between the states in a given year, and were there any noticeable geographic patterns or trends in these differences?

2. **Male and Female Population over time**:
How have the male and female population of Germany changed over time, and how do they compare to each other?

3. **Distribution of age groups**
In a given year, what was the distribution of the population of Germany across different age groups?


The data used was obtained from the "Statistisches Bundesamt" (https://www.destatis.de/), the federal statistical office of Germany.


For more details, where we describe the process of designing and implementation, see our written [report](./report.pdf).
